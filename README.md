# My background in C++
When I was first getting into studying computer science I was leaning towards game development.
Naturally, C++ made the most sense of the programming languages offered at FHDA. 
I completed the 3-course sequence at Foothill College CS 2A, 2B, and 2C with CS 2C being
their course in data structures and algorithms.
