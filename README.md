# C++ Programming Portfolio

## Background

My first-year studying computer science studies I was primarily interested in game development. Given C++'s prominence in the gaming industry, it was the natural choice among programming languages offered at Foothill College. 

## Education

I completed the comprehensive 3-course sequence at Foothill College:
- **CS 2A**: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with C++
- **CS 2B**: Intermediate Software Design in C++
- **CS 2C**: Data Structures and Algorithms using C++
- 
This Repository contains a sample of some of the assignments completed in the 2B and 2C courses.
