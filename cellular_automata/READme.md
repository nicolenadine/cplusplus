# Elementary Cellular Automaton

A C++ implementation of an elementary cellular automaton that displays patterns generated by different rule sets.

## Overview

This program implements an elementary cellular automaton, which is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where patterns evolve according to a set of rules. The implementation generates and displays patterns created by applying specific rules to a seed pattern over multiple generations.

## Features

- Supports elementary cellular automaton rules from 0 to 255
- Visual display of pattern generation using ASCII characters
- Configurable display width
- Automatic centering of patterns

## Technical Details

### Rule Implementation

The program implements elementary cellular automaton rules where:
- Each cell's new state depends on its current state and the states of its two adjacent neighbors
- Rules are represented as 8-bit integers (0-255)
- Each bit in the rule number determines the output for a specific neighborhood configuration

### Display

- Patterns are displayed as ASCII characters (`*` for "on" cells, spaces for "off" cells)
- Display width is configurable (odd numbers only, for centering)
- Default display width is 79 characters

## Usage

To use the automaton:

1. Create an `Automaton` object with a rule number between 0 and 255
2. Call `toStringCurrentGen()` to view the current generation
3. Call `propagateNewGeneration()` to advance to the next generation
4. Optionally use `setRule()` to change rules
5. Use `resetFirstGen()` to restart with the initial seed

## Example

```cpp
Automaton automaton(30);               // Create automaton with Rule 30
cout << automaton.toStringCurrentGen() << endl;  // Display initial generation

// Generate and display 100 generations
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    automaton.propagateNewGeneration();
    cout << automaton.toStringCurrentGen() << endl;
}
```

## Constants

- `MIN_DISPLAY_WIDTH`: 21 characters
- `MAX_DISPLAY_WIDTH`: 121 characters
- `DFLT_DISPLAY_WIDTH`: 79 characters
- `MIN_RULE`: 0
- `MAX_RULE`: 255

## Note

The project is implemented as a single file with the class definition included in the main file since it's a small, self-contained project.
